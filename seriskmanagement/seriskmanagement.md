### Introduction

1. You have registered to attend a local workshop about offensive cyber security tools. The workshop requires the attendees to bring their own laptops. This workshop is critical for you, and you want to get the most out of it. Your laptop is good and reliable; however, as with any electronic device, there is always a chance, no matter how minuscule, that something might go wrong and it would fail.You decide to carry an extra laptop; if your main laptop fails, the second laptop will be ready. What would you call this response to risk?

   The answer to this question can be found in the text.

2. You think your laptop has never failed before, and the chances of failing now are too slim. You decide not to take any extra actions. What do you call this response to risk?

### Respond to Risk

1. Click on View Site. Decide whether each of the suggested safeguards (controls) is justified. Follow the instructions to retrieve the flag.

   For eacht safeguard we must calculate the ALE before and after implementation. Subtract them from each other as well as the cost of the safe guard to find out if the safeguard is justified.

   We will use 1 to notate values before implementation of the safeguard and 2 for after.

   $ALE1 = (AssetValue * EF1) * ARO1$

   $SafeguardValue = ALE1 - ALE2 - SafeguardCost$

   RESPOND 1

   $ALE1 = (2000 * 0,5) * 2$

   $ALE2 = (2000 * 0,1) * 2$

   $SafeguardValue = 2000 - 400 - 20 = 1580$

   The value is positive, so it is justified to implement.

   RESPOND 2

   $ALE1 = (10000 * 0,25) * 0,35$

   $ALE2 = (2000 * 0) * 0,35$

   $SafeguardValue = 875 - 0 - 400 = 475$

   The value is positive, so it is justified to implement.

   RESPOND 3

   $ALE1 = (2000 * 0,5) * 0,25$

   $ALE2 = (2000 * 0,1) * 0,5$

   $SafeguardValue = 250 - 100 - 1500 = 1350$

   The value is negative, so it is not justified to implement.

### Monitor Risk

1. You want to confirm whether the new policy enforcing laptop disk encryption is helping mitigate data breach risk. What is it that you are monitoring in this case?

2. You are keeping an eye on new regulations and laws. What is it that you are monitoring?

### Putting It All Together

1. Click on View Site and follow the instructions to retrieve the flag. Remember that your decision should be based on the value of the safeguard to the organisation, which is calculated as follows: ValueofSafeguard = ALEbeforeSafeguard − ALEafterSafeguard − AnnualCostSafeguard

   TOGETHER SCREEN 1
   
   TOGETHER CONTROL 1 LAPTOP
   
   (2500 * 1) * 0,05

   (2500 * 0,06) *8* 0,05

   125 - 7,5 - 45 = 72,5

   The value is positive, so it is justified to implement.

   TOGETHER SCREEN 2

   TOGETHER CONTROL 2 WORKSTATION

   (3000 * 0,7) * 0,2

   (3000 * 0) * 0,2

   420 - 0 - 200 = 220

   The value is positive, so it is justified to implement.

   TOGETHER CONTROL 2 PHONE
   
   (1250 * 1) * 0,35

   (1250 * 0,4) * 0,35

   437,5 - 175 - 10 = 252,5

   The value is positive, so it is justified to implement.

   TOGETHER SCREEN 3

   TOGETHER CONTROL 3 OFFICE

   (20000 * 1) * 0,1

   (20000 * 0,15) * 0,1

   2000 - 300 - 750 = 950

   The value is positive, so it is justified to implement.

   TOGETHER CONTROL 3 WORKSTATION

   (3000 * 0,1) * 0,05

   (3000 * 0) * 0,05

   15 - 0 - 250 = -235

   The value is negative, so it is not justified to implement.

   TOGETHER CONTROL 3 LAPTOP

   (2500 * 1) * 0,2

   (2500 * 0,24) * 0,2

   500 - 120 - 75 = 305

   The value is positive, so it is justified to implement.

   TOGETHER CONTROL 3 

   (3000 * 0,85) * 0,35

   (3000 * 0,05) * 0,35

   595 - 52,5 - 75 = 467,5

   The value is positive, so it is justified to implement.
