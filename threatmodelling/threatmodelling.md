### Threat Modelling Overview

1. What is a weakness or flaw in a system, application, or process that can be exploited by a threat?

   The answer can be found in the text.

2. Based on the provided high-level methodology,Â what is the process of developing diagrams to visualise the organisation's architecture and dependencies?

   The answer can be found in the text.

3. What diagram describes and analyses potential threats against a system or application?

   The answer can be found in the text.

### Modelling with MITRE ATT&CK

1. What is the technique ID of "Exploit Public-Facing Application"?

   After opening the link to the "Exploit Public Facing Applications" technique, we can see the number in the details pane.

   MITRE TECHNIQUE

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>T1190</details>

2. Under what tactic does this technique belong?

   On the same page, we can find which tactis this technique belongs to.

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>Initial Access</details>

### Mapping with ATT&CK Navigator

1. How many MITRE ATT&CK techniques are attributed to APT33?

   After creating a new enterprise layer, use the search function to search for APT33. Then select all techniques associated with them. You can also click view to go the the MITRE page about this group. However, new techinques may have been added which gives a wrong total. Instead look at the amount of selected techniques in the top bar.

   MITRE APT33

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>31</details>

2. Upon applying the IaaS platform filter, how many techniques are under the Discovery tactic?

   Close the search field and open the filter field. Here deselect everything except for IaaS. Now we can see how many techniques are left under the Discovery Technique.

   MITRE IAAS

### DREAD Framework

1. What DREAD component assesses the potential harm from successfully exploiting a vulnerability?

   The answer can be found in the text.

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>Damage</details>

2. What DREAD component evaluates how others can easily find and identify the vulnerability?

   The answer can be found in the text.

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>Discoverability</details>

3. Which DREAD component considers the number of impacted users when a vulnerability is exploited?

   The answer can be found in the text.
