### Decoder: Overview

1. Which feature attempts auto-decode of the input?

   This is the button on the bottom of the page.

   OVERVIEW

### Decoder: Encoding/Decoding

Base64 encode the phrase: Let's Start Simple.

1. What is the base64 encoded version of this text?

   Use encode as base64.

URL Decode this data: %4e%65%78%74%3a%20%44%65%63%6f%64%69%6e%67.

2. What is the plaintext returned?

   Use decode as URL.

Use Smart decode to decode this data: &#x25;&#x33;&#x34;&#x25;&#x33;&#x37;.

3. What is the decoded text?

   Click the smart decode button.

   ENCODING SMART

Encode this phrase: Encoding Challenge.

Start with base64 encoding. Take the output of this and convert it into ASCII Hex. Finally, encode the hex string into octal.

4. What is the final string?

   First use encode as base64, then encode as ASCII hex, and finally use encode as octal.

   ENCODING OCTAL

### Decoder: Hashing

Using Decoder, what is the SHA-256 hashsum of the phrase: Let's get Hashing!?

1. Convert this into an ASCII Hex string for the answer to this question.

   First we select the SHA-256 hash. Then we encode the output as ASCII hex.

Let's look at an in-context example:

First, download the file attached to this task.

Note: This file can also be downloaded from the deployed VM with wget http://MACHINE_IP:9999/AlteredKeys.zip — you may find this helpful if you are using the AttackBox.

Now read the problem specification below:

"Some joker has messed with my SSH key! There are four keys in the directory, and I have no idea which is the real one. The MD5 hashsum for my key is 3166226048d6ad776370dc105d40d9f8 — could you find it for me?"

3. What is the correct key name?

   After hashing the key files, we get on hash that is the same as the provided hash.

### Sequencer: Overview

1. What does Sequencer allow us to evaluate?

   This answers can be found in the text.

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>Entropy</details>

### Sequencer: Live Capture

1. What is the overall quality of randomness estimated to be?

   Make sure you capture the request of the webpage itself, not the login attempt. Send the request to sequencer and select the token form field.

   Start the live capture and wait until you have around 10000 tokens before performing the analysis.

   CAPTURE quality
