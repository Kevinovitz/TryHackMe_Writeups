2. We cannot attach external storage to theVM, so we have created a `/home/tryhackme/secretvault.img` file instead. It is encrypted with the password `2N9EdZYNkszEE3Ad`. To access it, you need to open it using `cryptsetup` and then mount it to an empty directory, such as `myvault`. What is the flag in the secret vault?

   First we must open the encrypted image using `cryptsetup`.

   ```console
   sudo cryptsetup luksOpen secretvault.img secretvault
   or
   sudo cryptsetup open --type luks /path/to/dump desired-name
   ```

   Now we can mount this device to the `myvault` folder and look inside.

   ```console
   sudo umount /dev/mapper/secretvault
   ```

   FILESYSTEM OPEN

   Now we can check to see if the device is mounted and look for our flag.
