### Proxy Introduction to the Burp Proxy

1. Which button would we choose to send an intercepted request to the target in Burp Proxy?

   On the proxy tab we can enable intercept, open the browser, and navigating to tryhackme.com. 
   
   ![Intercepted](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/burpsuitebasics/Burp_Suite_The_Basics_Intro_To_Proxy_Intercepted.png)
   
   If we want to send the request to the browser, we must click forward.
   
   ![Forwarded](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/burpsuitebasics/Burp_Suite_The_Basics_Intro_To_Proxy_Forwarded.png)

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>Forward</details>

2. [Research] What is the default keybind for this? **Note**: Assume you are using Windows or Linux (i.e. swap Cmd for Ctrl). 

   With a quick search we can find the required hotkey.

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>Ctrl+F</details>

### Proxy Connecting through the Proxy (FoxyProxy)

Read through the options in the right-click menu.

1. There is one particularly useful option that allows you to intercept and modify the response to your request.

   What is this option? 

   First we make sure to enable the intercept in BurpSuite and FoxyProxy in Firefox.
   
   ![Intercepted](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/burpsuitebasics/Burp_Suite_The_Basics_Connecting_Through_Proxy_Intercepted.png)
   
   After intercepting the request we can inspect the menu options.

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>Response to this request</details>

### Proxy Proxying HTTPS

I had already configure Firefox before with the certificate for Burp Suite. However, when trying in this room, it seemed to not work anymore. Even downloading the certificate didn't work.

So I made a backup of the current certificate that was loaded, deleted it, and then I could download the certificate again. 

After importing it, I could visit TLS enabled websites in Firefox through FoxyProxy.

### Proxy Scoping and Targeting

No real difference was spotted when targeting the specific URL (http://http://10.10.195.240/). This might be due to the website having no redirects.

![Not Scoped](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/burpsuitebasics/Burp_Suite_The_Basics_Scoping_Targeting_Not_Scoped.png)

### Proxy Site Map and Issue Definitions

Take a look around the site. Visit every page linked to from the homepage, then check your sitemap -- one endpoint should stand out as being very unusual!

Visit this in your browser (or use the "Response" section of the site map entry for that endpoint)

1. What is the flag you receive?

   After visting all sites, we can see our sitemap in BurpSuite
   
   ![URL](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/burpsuitebasics/Burp_Suite_The_Basics_Sitemap_URL.png)
   
   One of these entries does indeed stand out. Lets visit it to see if we get our flag.
   
   ![Flag](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/burpsuitebasics/Burp_Suite_The_Basics_Sitemap_Flag.png)

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>THM{NmNlZTliNGE1MWU1ZTQzMzgzNmFiNWVk}</details>

Look through the Issue Definitions list.

2. What is the typical severity of a Vulnerable JavaScript dependency?

   If we navigate to the Issue Definitions list related to our sitemap, we can find the severity for a Vulnerable JavaScript dependency.
   
   ![Vulnerability](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/burpsuitebasics/Burp_Suite_The_Basics_Sitemap_Vulnerability.png)
   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>Low</details>

### Practical Example Attack 

Try to bypass the filter to achieve Cross Site Scripting.

First thing to try obviously, is our payload, to see if it is indeed filtered. This does seem to be the case unfortunately.

After making sure FoxyProxy in Firefox and Intercept in BurpSuite are both turned on, we can enter some fake but allowed data.

![Query](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/burpsuitebasics/Burp_Suite_The_Basics_Example_Query.png)

After submitting, we should have intercepted the request in BurpSuite.

![Request](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/burpsuitebasics/Burp_Suite_The_Basics_Example_Request.png)

Now we can change the email part of the request with our own payload:

```cmd
<script>alert("Succ3ssful XSS")</script>
```

![Script](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/burpsuitebasics/Burp_Suite_The_Basics_Example_Script.png)

Now select the payload and use the `Ctrl + u` shortcut to encode the string.

![Script Encoded](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/burpsuitebasics/Burp_Suite_The_Basics_Example_Script_Encoded.png)

Now we forward the modified request with BurpSuite and we should receieve a pop-up message.

![Success](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/burpsuitebasics/Burp_Suite_The_Basics_Example_Success.png)
