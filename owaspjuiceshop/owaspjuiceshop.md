### Let's go on an adventure!

1. Question #1: What's the Administrator's email address?

   Clicking one of the products gives us the admin's email address in the review.

### Inject the juice

1. Question #1: Log into the administrator account!

   We can use Burpsuite to intercept and modify the request or we can input in directly into the username field.

3. Question #2: Log into the Bender account!

   Now we do the same, but we add the user's email and add `'--` to the end.

### Who broke my lock?!

1. Question #1: Bruteforce the Administrator account's password!

   First lets intercept a login request using the admin's password. And send it to Intruder in Burpsuite.

   ![Lock Request](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/owaspjuiceshop/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Lock_Request.png)

   Now we add a position for the password field. We don't have to do this for the username as we will be using the same for each try.

   ![Lock Positions](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/owaspjuiceshop/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Lock_Positions.png)

   Next we add items to try from a wordlist from Seclists (best1050).

   ![Lock Payloads](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/owaspjuiceshop/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Lock_Payloads.png)

   Now we start the attack and wait for a response status of 200, this should be our password.

   ![Lock Password](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/owaspjuiceshop/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Lock_Password.png)

   Finally, we can log in with the password we found.

3. Question #2: Reset Jim's password!

   For this we can simply answer the security question with the answer from the text.

### AH! Don't look!

1. Question #1: Access the Confidential Document!

   Looking at the url for the legal document, we can access the ftp server directly.

   ![Look Ftp](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/owaspjuiceshop/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Look_Ftp.png)
   
   From here we get a flag for accessing secret documents.

3. Question #2: Log into MC SafeSearch's account!

   After watching the clip (or using the text) we can log into Mc Safe Search's account.

   ![Look Mcsafe Login](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/owaspjuiceshop/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Look_Mcsafe_Login.png)

5. Question #3: Download the Backup file!

   Using the Poison Null Byte as suggested, we can bypass the file extension restriction and download the backup file.

   ```cmd
   10.10.204.165/ftp/package.json.bak%2500.md
   ```

   ![Look Backup](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/owaspjuiceshop/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Look_Backup.png)

### Who's flying this thing?

1. Question #1: Access the administration page!

   Looking at the javascript in the debugger we see this mention of an administration panel.
   
   ![Flying Admin](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/owaspjuiceshop/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Flying_Admin.png)

   Logging into the admin account with our previously found credentials and navigating to `#/administration` gives us access to the admin panel.

3. Question #2: View another user's shopping basket!

   First we capture the request and change the basket number to something else.

   ![Flying Request](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/owaspjuiceshop/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Flying_Request.png)

   This lets us view another user's basket.

5. Question #3: Remove all 5-star reviews!

   Under the feedback column, we can delete a five-start review.

   ![Flying Remove](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/owaspjuiceshop/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Flying_Remove.png)

   ![Flying Flag](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/owaspjuiceshop/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Flying_Flag.png)

### Where did that come from?

1. Question #1: Perform a DOM XSS!

   For our first XSS attack we use the following code in the search bar.

   ```cmd
   <iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)"> 
   ```

   ![Where DOM](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/owaspjuiceshop/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Where_DOM.png)

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>9aaf4bbea5c30d00a1f5bbcfce4db6d4b0efe0bf</details>

3. Question #2: Perform a persistent XSS!

   For this XSS attack we enable intercept in Burpsuite and log out of our account. In this request we head the following header.

   ```cmd
   True-Client-IP: <iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)">
   ```

   ![Where Header](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/owaspjuiceshop/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Where_Header.png)

   Now we can log back in again and go to the last login ip page.

   ![Where IP](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/owaspjuiceshop/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Where_IP.png)

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>149aa8ce13d7a4a8a931472308e269c94dc5f156</details>

5. Question #3: Perform a reflected XSS!

   For this final XSS attack we navigate to the order history page and click on the track button.

   ![Where Order](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/owaspjuiceshop/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Where_Order.png)

   Now we can cange the `id` parameter in the URL with:

   ```cmd
    ```cmd
   <iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)"> 
   ```

   ![Where Flag](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/owaspjuiceshop/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Where_Flag.png)
