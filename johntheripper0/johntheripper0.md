### Cracking Windows Authentication Hashes

1. What do we need to set the "format" flag to, in order to crack this?

   As the name comes from NTHash, 'NT' might be a first guess. Looking at the available formats we can see this is indeed the case.

   ```cmd
   john --list=formats | grep -iF "nt" 
   ```

   WINDOWS FORMAT

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>NT</details>

3. What is the cracked value of this password?

   We can use the following command with John to crack the NTLM hash.

   ```cmd
   john ntlm.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=nt
   ```

   WINDOWS VALUE
   
   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>mushroom</details>

### Cracking /etc/shadow Hashes

1. What is the root password?

   For this question we can do multiple things. One is to simple copy the hash into a separate file and crack it with John. Or we can split the entries into their respective files and with `unshadow` create a single file we can use in John. For now I will use the latter method.

   ```cmd
   unshadow passwd.txt shadow.txt > Passwords.txt
   ```

   SHADOW FILE

   This gives us one file with the hash and username.

   ```cmd
   john Passwords.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=sha512crypt
   ```

   SHADOW VALUE

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>1234</details>

### Single Crack Mode

1. What is Joker's password?

   First we need to add the username in front of the hash, then we can use Johns single mode cracking.

   ```cmd
   joker:<hash>
   
   john --single --format=raw-md5 hash7.txt
   ```

   SINGLE VALUE

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>Jok3r</details>

### Custom Rules

1.  What do custom rules allow us to exploit?

   This answer can be found in the text.

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>password complexity predictability</details>

2. What rule would we use to add all capital letters to the end of the word?

   Using the information from the text we can get the answer.

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>Az"[A-Z]"</details>

3. What flag would we use to call a custom rule called "THMRules"

    This can be found in the text.

   ><details><summary>Click for answer</summary>--rule=THMRules</details>
   
### Cracking Password Protected Zip Files

1.  What is the password for the secure.zip file?

   We first use `zip2john` to get a hash and then pass that through to john.

   ```cmd
   zip2john secure.zip > ziphash.txt

   john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ziphash.txt
   ```

   ZIP PASSWORD

### Cracking Password Protected RAR Archives

1. What is the password for the secure.rar file?

   We first use `rar2john` to get a hash and then pass that through to john.

   ```cmd
   rar2john secure.rar > rarhash.txt

   john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt rarhash.txt
   ```

   ssh2john idrsa.id_rsa > sshhash.txt
   
   john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt sshhash.txt
   ```
