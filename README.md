# TryHackMe Writeups

In this repository you will find various walkthroughs/writeups for various [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) rooms. This is mostly for my own use as a sort of knowledge base. But anyone is welcome to view it themselves.

The following rooms are available/in progress:

- [Advent of Cyber #1 [2019]](25daysofchristmas/25daysofchristmas.md)
- [Linux Fundamentals Part 1](linuxfundamentalspart1/linuxfundamentalspart1.md)
- more to come
