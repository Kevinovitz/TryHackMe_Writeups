### Enumeration w/ Powerview

These questions were a bit difficult as there was no single point of information to use. Multiple posts had different commands, some of which wouldn't work. Some were not listed on each site.

1. What is the shared folder that is not set by default?

   For this I found two commands that could be of use.

   ```cmd
   Get-NetShare

   Invoke-ShareFinder
   ```

   Both would give the attached shared folders. The one without a description is most likely not default.

   POWERVIEW SHARED

3. What operating system is running inside of the network besides Windows Server 2019?

   The command that could help with this is `Get-NetComputer`. This would only return a long list of data when used with `-FullData`. Now all we need to do is filter on the operating system as done in the example.

   ```cmd
   Get-NetComputer -FullData | select operatingsystem
   ```

   POWERVIEW OPERATING

5. I've hidden a flag inside of the users find it

   For this we can actually use the same command as in the example to view the common name (cn) of the user.

   ```cmd
   Get-NetUser | select cn
   ```

   POWERVIEW FLAG
